### Hi my name is Karolis ðŸ‘‹

I recently completed a data analytics course that covered a range of topics from SQL in BigQuery to data visualization using dashboards adn I am still improving my knowledge further. I'm passionate about using data to make informed decisions, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a data analyst.

During my course, I gained hands-on experience working with SQL in BigQuery, which allowed me to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from large datasets. I also learned how to create visually appealing and interactive dashboards using various tools like Google Data Studio. As a result, I'm comfortable with data manipulation, data visualization, and data analysis.

I'm excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a data analyst role, where I can continue to develop my expertise in using data to drive business decisions. Thanks for taking the time to read my profile, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or opportunities to discuss!
